```                                                                            .
*  - Paskowy was only used as reference, no distributables or binaries of
     Paskowy are present in the source of Pixelary.
** - Paskowy's license may have changed since Pixelary's release, it seems like
     Paskowy is no longer free for commercial use, but I can't find a way or
     source to license Paskowy from the author.
